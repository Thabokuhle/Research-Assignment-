## 🗂️ Section A: Database Fundamentals

### 1. Main Types of Databases
- Relational Databases (SQL)
- NoSQL Databases
- Cloud Databases
- Graph Databases
- Time-Series Databases

### 2. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
An RDBMS stores data in structured tables using rows and columns and allows data manipulation using SQL.

### 3. Primary Key & Foreign Key
- Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record.
- Foreign Key: Links one table to another.

### 4. Database Normalization
The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

### 5. Database Schema
A blueprint that defines tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.

### 6. Data Types
- Structured
- Semi-Structured
- Unstructured

### 7. Fact Table vs Dimension Table
- Fact Table: Numerical business metrics.
- Dimension Table: Descriptive attributes.

### 8. Data Model
Defines how data is structured and related within a database.

### 9. Database vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lake
- Database: Operational data
- Data Warehouse: Historical analytics data
- Data Lake: Raw structured & unstructured data

### 10. Data Mart
A subject-specific subset of a data warehouse.

## 🧮 Section B: SQL & Data Processing

### 11. SQL Query Language
SQL is used to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data in relational databases.

### 12. Indexes
Improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval.

### 13. Transactions & ACID Properties
Ensure data reliability and consistency.

### 14. Database Engine
Handles data storage, indexing, and query execution.

### 15. Views, Stored Procedures & Triggers
- View: Virtual table
- Stored Procedure: Reusable SQL code
- Trigger: Automatically executes on events

### 16. ETL vs ELT
- ETL: Transform before loading
- ELT: Transform after loading (cloud-based)

### 17. Batch vs Stream Processing
- Batch: Periodic processing
- Stream: Real-time processing

### 18. SQL Joins
INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS joins.

### 19. Referential Integrity
Ensures relationships between tables remain valid.

---

## ☁️ Section C: Cloud & Data Governance

### 20. Cloud vs On-Premise Databases
- Cloud: Scalable, managed, pay-as-you-go
- On-Premise: Hardware-based, fully managed internally

### 21. Data Governance
Policies and processes that ensure data accuracy, security, and compliance.

### 22. Data Integrity
Maintains data accuracy and reliability using constraints and validations.

### 23. Data Quality
Ensures data is accurate, complete, consistent, and timely for analytics.

## 👨‍💻 Section D: Roles & Responsibilities

### 24. Role of a Data Analyst
- Querying data using SQL
- Cleaning and analyzing data
- Creating reports and dashboards
- Communicating insights

### 25. Role of a Database Administrator (DBA)
- Database maintenance
- Performance tuning
- Security and access control
- Backup and recovery

---

## 🔄 Section E: Data Pipelines & Platforms

### 26. Data Pipeline Design Steps
1. Data source identification
2. Extraction
3. Transformation
4. Loading
5. Orchestration
6. Monitoring

### 27. Challenges in Large-Scale Databases
- Performance
- Scalability
- Security
- Data quality
- Cost management

### 28. Popular Database Platforms
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- Snowflake
- SQL Server
- MongoDB

### 29. Data Storage Formats
- CSV
- JSON
- Parquet
- Avro
